= DESCRIPTION:

Installs the Marionette Collective

= PLATFORMS:

Tested as working:
 * Ubuntu (10.04, 12.04)
 * Centos (5.5, 5.6, 6.0)

Likely to work without modification on Debian, RHEL, Fedora (if you try, please let me know).


= REQUIREMENTS:

A STOMP server.

Cookbooks
---------
* apt
* yum
* chef_handler

The `apt_repository` and `yum_repository` LWRPs are optionally used to create entries for the puppetlabs repository.
The `chef_handler` LWRP is used to install a report handler (::server only)


= ATTRIBUTES:

Version:
* mcollective['package']['version'] - the version of MCollective to install.

Security:
* mcollective['securityprovider'] - the security plugin to use (default: "psk")
* mcollective['psk'] - the key for the "psk" security provider.

Message Broker connection settings:
* mcollective['connector'] - which connection plugin to use (default: "stomp")

STOMP service connection details (used by "stomp" and "activemq" plugins):
* mcollective['stomp']['hostname']
* mcollective['stomp']['port']
* mcollective['stomp']['username']
* mcollective['stomp']['password']

Site Plugin path:
* mcollective['site_plugins'] - installation location for extra plugins (this is added to the MCollective plugin path)

Facts:
* mcollective['factsource'] - sets where MCollective gets facts from
* mcollective['fact_whitelist'] - Ohai fact groups to include when using the 'yaml' factsource.


= USAGE:

Add recipe[mcollective] to your run_list to install the server and client tools.

Set the node's mcollective['stomp'] attributes to point to your server (or use role/environment attributes).  The default expects a STOMP server on localhost configured as per http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/reference/basic/gettingstarted.html#configuring-stomp

MCollective's "class list" will be populated with the roles and recipes present in the expanded run list of the last Chef run.

You can customise installation by choosing from these recipes instead of the default:
* recipe[mcollective::server] installs the server components.
* recipe[mcollective::client] installs the client components.
* recipe[mcollective::puppetlabs-repo] installs the Puppetlabs apt/yum repo.

= EXTENSION:

This cookbook installs the MCollective packages using the repositories
provided by PuppetLabs. If you have a local mirror of the required
packages, set node['mcollective']['enable_puppetlabs_repo'] to false.
If you need to make more extensive changes, write your own recipes and
update node['mcollective']['install_recipe'] to use them instead.


= TODO:

* Updates to common configuration should restart the server (but only if it is configured on the node)
* Configurable fact- and class-file names
* Tests
